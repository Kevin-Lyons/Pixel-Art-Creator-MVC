# CSCI 338 Class Project
This is a project to demonstrate the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
The program can be used to create pixel art

# The assignment

1. As a group, create a graphical application that follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
2. You might consider using GitHub to share things? Design and document it with UML? ( These are not required ). 
3. The application can be any technology you are comfortable with like Java, Windows, Mac, Web and Mobile.
4. As a group submit, a write up of your design, screen shots, and experiences. Submit a PDF to Moodle please (one per group). It would be nice if the document had a list of all the group members (full names this time).
5. As a group, create a presentation to show off what fun you had. Submit the presentation as a PDF to Moodle. The content will be graded but not the actual performance. All group members must say something. Demonstrate your application to the class.
